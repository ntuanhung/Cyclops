##Timeline

##Commitment:

- Keep working gradually. Nothing will happen suddenly like a magic. 
- If you are busy due to some personal issues, we understand. Let all members know that. We need to delegate tasks to someone else and keep the work pace.

- Decision-making: MP - A; TH - A; 
- Task assigning: switching between MP and TH
